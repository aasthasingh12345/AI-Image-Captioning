# AI-Image-Captioning

This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to automatically generate captions for images. With this model, you can add descriptive and contextually relevant captions to your images.

## How it Works

1. **Image Feature Extraction (CNN)**: The project uses a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) to extract meaningful features from input images. These features capture visual information from the images.

2. **Caption Generation (RNN)**: A Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM or GRU) takes the image features as input and generates captions word by word. The RNN learns to predict the next word in the caption based on the previously generated words.

3. **Training Data**: The model is trained on a dataset containing images paired with their corresponding captions. The objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted captions and the ground truth captions.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-captioning.git
   cd ai-image-captioning

   Usage
Training: To train or fine-tune the model, follow the instructions in the train.ipynb notebook. You can use your own dataset or a publicly available image captioning dataset.

Inference: After training, you can use the trained model for image captioning. Modify the generate_caption() function in app.py to provide the path to the image you want to caption.
